WHAT IS REVERSE TCP?
- A reverse TCP connection/payload is a way to establish a connection from a target
system back to the attacker's system, allowing the attacker to gain access to the target system.

The victim's system becomes the server and that of the attacker becomes the client.
It's used when the attacker wants to bypass firewall rules, network security measures or 
Network Address Translation (NAT) setups on the victim's network.
